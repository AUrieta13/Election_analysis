## Challenge Overview

### Overview of Election Audit:
After helping Tom and Set submit the election audit results to the election commssion, the commision has requested additinal information that includes, the voter turnout for each county, percentage of votes from each county out of a total count, and the county with the highest turnout. The requested written analysis will be provided to the election commission to help the audienec understand the process of how the data was analyzed.
### Election- Audit Results:
- In the congressional election, there were a total of 369,711 casted throughout all of the counties that participated.
- After creating a code to breakdown the numbers of votes and percentage of total votes for each county, the results presented below are the outcome from the code created.

- Based are the data displayed above, the county with the largest number of votes was Denver. *Refer to image above.* 
- After creating a code to breakdown the numbers of votes and percentage of total votes for each candidate in the election, the resulted are presented below with the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate receieved.

## Challenge Summary
### Election-Audit Summary:
- To the election commission, the following results are based off data collected from the election poll for each county. The script written to gather the requested anaylsis is a good example of how else the script can be used or modified for any election. The script could also be modified by going into more depth and adding cities from each county to conclude which city from each ounty had the largest vote turnout. Another way the this script could be used is to collect data with the total votes of each state in the United States and create an analysis to see which state had the largest vote turn out based on comparing the number of votes of other states. The script  created can either be used to go more in depth with data or also work in a larger scale of data to get more board results.
